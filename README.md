# Table-Tennis-Code-Edit
Table Tennis is a JavaScript game created by user saroj22322(Saroj Tripathi) on GitHub which I edited for the Week 6 Project of South Puget Sound Community College's CIS(Computer Information Systems) 269 class taught by Michael Haensel during the Spring Quarter of 2023. The edits I made consisted of slightly changing the scoreboard to better differentiate which score was which and to allow the game box to fill in the screen, removing any unused whitespace, when the player pressed play. In addition I added looping background music and changed out the sound that was made when a player scored a point.
